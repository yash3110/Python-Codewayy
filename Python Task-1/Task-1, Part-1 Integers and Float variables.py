#Task-1
#Part 1
#Sum of two numbers

#Initialize the numbers
no.1 = 17
no.2 = 17.64

#Initialize the variables
sum = 0
difference = 0
quotient = 0
remainder = 0
product = 0

#Finding the result
sum = no.1 + no.2
difference = no.2 - no.1
quotient = no.2 / no.1
remainder = no.2 % no.1
product = no.1 * no.2

#Printing the result
print("The sum is:", sum)
print("The difference is:", difference)
print("The quotient is:", quotient)
print("The remainder is:", remainder)
print("The product is:", product)
